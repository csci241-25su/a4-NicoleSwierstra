The DB1BParser parses a CSV file from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics'
Origin and Destination Survey dataset, available from the BTS website:

    https://transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=125

Download a csv file from the DB1BCoupon dataset and extract it in this
directory. You can either check the "Prezipped File" box, or you can select the
specific columns that the DB1BParser expects.  

Then, run your ShortestPaths program with the db1b fileType and the csv
filename.  The dataset is large, so it may take a few seconds to run Dijkstra
on the whole graph!
